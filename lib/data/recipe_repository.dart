Cheesy roll ups are better because I know how to make them. Let me think…one time I made candy and it turned brown. I don’t want tacos anymore. I like them, but I love cheesy roll ups more. I don’t like beans because they make me throw up. My mom made me eat a burrito one time with beans and I threw up.
